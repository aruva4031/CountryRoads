Country Roads

Through the code, we had implemented the outcomes expected for the project. For example, the car addresses physics-based simulations and lighting with its controls. Some concepts had to be altered and done differently, though, because of time constraints and the need for alternate solutions.

Jessica: I'm pretty glad on how the BrightLight script turned out, with all the features required of it, and that it runs correctly when implemented. It was satisfying being able to adjust the intensity effects of the orb and alter its appearance, then seeing immediate results for it.

Julia: I'm pretty happy how the event generation turned out. Not everything is perfect, but overall, after all the work throughout the project, it was good to see that the events somehow worked. It was great to be able to create events that are different based on the player's actions, and it was satisfying to see that I was capable of programming it.
